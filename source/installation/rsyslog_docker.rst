Using Rsyslog Docker Containers
===============================

The rsyslog project provides a ready-to-run "syslog appliance" which provides
all rsyslog features in an easy to use way. To run it, simply do

|DockerApplianceAlpineRun|

Up-to-date information on how to use this container can be found at
Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/rsyslog/syslog_appliance_alpine/.

.. warning::

   The docker containers are currently (early 2018) under development
   and must be used with some care.

Further Information
-------------------
The rsyslog project provides a number of different containers for
different needs (end users, developers, package builders, ...). A full
overview of what is currently available can be found at |DockerHubURL|.
