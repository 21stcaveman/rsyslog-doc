imuxsock: Unix Socket Input
***************************

===========================  ===========================================================================
**Module Name:**Â             **imuxsock**
**Author:**                  `Rainer Gerhards <http://www.gerhards.net/rainer>`_ <rgerhards@adiscon.com>
===========================  ===========================================================================


Purpose
=======

This module provides the ability to accept syslog messages from applications
running on the local system via Unix sockets. Most importantly, this is the
mechanism by which the :manpage:`syslog(3)` call delivers syslog messages
to rsyslogd.

Notable Features
================

- :ref:`rate-limiting-label`
- :ref:`trusted-properties-label`
- :ref:`flow-control-label`
- :ref:`application-timestamps-label`
- :ref:`systemd-details-label`


Configuration Parameters
========================

.. note::

   Parameter names are case-insensitive.

Global Parameters
-----------------

.. warning::

   When running under systemd, **many "sysSock." parameters are ignored**.
   See parameter descriptions and the :ref:`systemd-details-label` section for
   details.

-  **SysSock.IgnoreTimestamp** [**on**/off]
   Ignore timestamps included in the messages, applies to messages
   received via the system log socket.

-  **SysSock.IgnoreOwnMessages** [**on**/off] (available since 7.3.7)
   Ignores messages that originated from the same instance of rsyslogd.
   There usually is no reason to receive messages from ourselves. This
   setting is vital when writing messages to the Linux journal. See
   :doc:`omjournal <omjournal>` module documentation for a more
   in-depth description.

-  **SysSock.Use** (imuxsock) [**on**/off] - Listen on the default local
   log socket (``/dev/log``) or, if provided, use the log socket value
   assigned to the ``SysSock.Name`` parameter instead of the default. This
   is most useful if you run multiple instances of rsyslogd where only one
   shall handle the system log socket.  Unless disabled by the
   ``SysSock.Unlink`` setting, this socket is created upon rsyslog startup
   and deleted upon shutdown, according to traditional syslogd behavior.

   The behavior of this parameter is different for systemd systems. For those
   systems, ``SysSock.Use`` still needs to be enabled, but the value of
   ``SysSock.Name`` is ignored and the socket provided by systemd is used
   instead. If this parameter is *not* enabled, then imuxsock will only be
   of use if a custom input is configured.

   See the :ref:`systemd-details-label` section for details.

-  **SysSock.Name** <name-of-socket> - specifies an alternate log socket
   to be used instead of the default system log socket, traditionally
   ``/dev/log``. Unless disabled by the ``SysSock.Unlink`` setting,
   this socket is created upon rsyslog startup and deleted upon shutdown,
   according to traditional syslogd behavior.

   The behavior of this parameter is different for systemd systems. See the
   the :ref:`systemd-details-label` section for details.

-  **SysSock.FlowControl** [on/**off**] - specifies if flow control
   should be applied to the system log socket.

-  **SysSock.UsePIDFromSystem** [on/**off**] - specifies if the pid
   being logged shall be obtained from the log socket itself. If so, the
   TAG part of the message is rewritten. It is recommended to turn this
   option on, but the default is "off" to keep compatible with earlier
   versions of rsyslog.

-  **SysSock.RateLimit.Interval** [number] - specifies the rate-limiting
   interval in seconds. Default value is 0, which turns off rate
   limiting. Set it to a number of seconds (5 recommended) to activate
   rate-limiting. The default of 0 has been chosen as people experienced
   problems with this feature activated by default. Now it needs an
   explicit opt-in by setting this parameter.

-  **SysSock.RateLimit.Burst** [number] - specifies the rate-limiting
   burst in number of messages. Default is 200.

-  **SysSock.RateLimit.Severity** [numerical severity] - specifies the
   severity of messages that shall be rate-limited.

-  **SysSock.UseSysTimeStamp** [**on**/off] the same as the input
   parameter ``UseSysTimeStamp``, but for the system log socket. See
   description there.

-  **SysSock.Annotate** <on/**off**> turn on annotation/trusted
   properties for the system log socket.

-  **SysSock.ParseTrusted** <on/**off**> if Annotation is turned on,
   create JSON/lumberjack properties out of the trusted properties
   (which can be accessed via RainerScript JSON Variables, e.g. ``$!pid``)
   instead of adding them to the message.

-  **SysSock.Unlink** <**on**/off> (available since 7.3.9)
   if turned on (default), the system socket is unlinked and re-created
   when opened and also unlinked when finally closed. Note that this
   setting has no effect when running under systemd control (because
   systemd handles the socket).

-  **sysSock.useSpecialParser** (available since 8.9.0)
   The equivalent of the ``useSpecialParser`` input parameter for the
   system socket.

-  **sysSock.parseHostname** (available since 8.9.0)
   The equivalent of the ``parseHostname`` input parameter for the
   system socket.

Input Parameters
----------------

-  **ruleset** [name]
   Binds specified ruleset to this input. If not set, the default
   ruleset is bound. (available since 8.17.0)

-  **IgnoreTimestamp** [**on**/off]
   Ignore timestamps included in messages received from the input being
   defined.

-  **IgnoreOwnMessages** [**on**/off] (available since 7.3.7)
   Ignore messages that originated from the same instance of rsyslogd.
   There usually is no reason to receive messages from ourselves. This
   setting is vital when writing messages to the Linux journal. See
   :doc:`omjournal <omjournal>` module documentation for a more
   in-depth description.

-  **FlowControl** [on/**off**] - specifies if flow control should be
   applied to the input being defined.

-  **RateLimit.Interval** [number] - specifies the rate-limiting
   interval in seconds. Default value is 0, which turns off rate
   limiting. Set it to a number of seconds (5 recommended) to activate
   rate-limiting. The default of 0 has been chosen as people experienced
   problems with this feature activated by default. Now it needs an
   explicit opt-in by setting this parameter.

-  **RateLimit.Burst** [number] - specifies the rate-limiting burst in
   number of messages. Default is 200.

-  **RateLimit.Severity** [numerical severity] - specifies the severity
   of messages that shall be rate-limited.

-  **UsePIDFromSystem** [on/**off**] - specifies if the pid being logged
   shall be obtained from the log socket itself. If so, the TAG part of
   the message is rewritten. It is recommended to turn this option on,
   but the default is "off" to keep compatible with earlier versions of
   rsyslog.

-  **UseSysTimeStamp** [**on**/off] instructs imuxsock to obtain message
   time from the system (via control messages) instead of using time
   recorded inside the message. This may be most useful in combination
   with systemd. Note: this option was introduced with version 5.9.1.
   Due to the usefulness of it, we decided to enable it by default. As
   such, 5.9.1 and above behave slightly different than previous
   versions. However, we do not see how this could negatively affect
   existing environments.

-  **CreatePath** [on/**off**] - create directories in the socket path
   if they do not already exist. They are created with 0755 permissions
   with the owner being the process under which rsyslogd runs. The
   default is not to create directories. Keep in mind, though, that
   rsyslogd always creates the socket itself if it does not exist (just
   not the directories by default).
   This option is primarily considered useful for defining additional
   sockets that reside on non-permanent file systems. As rsyslogd probably
   starts up before the daemons that create these sockets, it is a vehicle
   to enable rsyslogd to listen to those sockets even though their directories
   do not yet exist.

-  **Socket** <name-of-socket> adds additional unix socket, default none
   -- former -a option

-  **HostName** <hostname> permits to override the hostname that shall
   be used inside messages taken from the input that is being defined.

-  **Annotate** <on/**off**> turn on annotation/trusted properties for
   the input that is being defined.

-  **ParseTrusted** <on/**off**> equivalent to the ``SysSock.ParseTrusted``
   module parameter, but applies to the input that is being defined.

-  **Unlink** <**on**/off> (available since 7.3.9)
   if turned on (default), the socket is unlinked and re-created when
   opened and also unlinked when finally closed. Set it to off if you
   handle socket creation yourself. Note that handling socket creation
   oneself has the advantage that a limited amount of messages may be
   queued by the OS if rsyslog is not running.

-  **useSpecialParser** <**on**/off> (available since 8.9.0)
   If turned on (the default and the way it was up until 8.8.0) a
   special parser is used that parses the format that is usually
   used on the system log socket (the one :manpage:`syslog(3)` creates).
   If set to "off", the regular parser chain is used, in which case
   the format on the log socket can be arbitrary.
   Note that when the special parser is used, rsyslog is able to
   inject a more precise timestamp into the message (it is obtained
   from the log socket). If the regular parser chain is used, this
   is not possible.

-  **parseHostname** <on/**off**> (available since 8.9.0)
   Normally, the local log sockets do *not* contain hostnames. With
   this directive, the parser chain can be instructed to not
   expect them (setting "off", the default). If set to on, parsers
   will expect hostnames just like in regular formats.
   Note: this option only has an effect if ``useSpecialParsers`` is
   set to "off".

.. _rate-limiting-label:

Input rate limiting
===================

.. versionadded:: 5.7.1

rsyslog supports (optional) input rate limiting to guard against the problems
of a wild running logging process. If more than
``SysSock.RateLimit.Interval`` \* ``SysSock.RateLimit.Burst`` log messages
are emitted from the same process, those messages with
``SysSock.RateLimit.Severity`` or lower will be dropped. It is not possible
to recover anything about these messages, but imuxsock will tell you how
many it has dropped once the interval has expired AND the next message is
logged. Rate-limiting depends on ``SCM\_CREDENTIALS``. If the platform does
not support this socket option, rate limiting is turned off. If multiple
sockets are configured, rate limiting works independently on each of
them (that should be what you usually expect). The same functionality is
available for additional log sockets, in which case the config
statements just use the prefix RateLimit... but otherwise works exactly
the same. When working with severities, please keep in mind that higher
severity numbers mean lower severity and configure things accordingly.
To turn off rate limiting, set the interval to zero.

.. _trusted-properties-label:

Trusted (syslog) properties
===========================

.. versionadded:: 5.9.4

rsyslog can annotate messages from system log sockets (via imuxsock) with
so-called `Trusted syslog
properties <http://www.rsyslog.com/what-are-trusted-properties/>`_, (or just
"Trusted Properties" for short). These are message properties not provided by
the logging client application itself, but rather obtained from the system.
As such, they can not be faked by the user application and are trusted in
this sense. This feature is based on a similar idea introduced in systemd.

This feature requires a recent enough Linux Kernel and access to
the ``/proc`` file system. In other words, this may not work on all
platforms and may not work fully when privileges are dropped (depending
on how they are dropped). Note that trusted properties can be very
useful, but also typically cause the message to grow rather large. Also,
the format of log messages is changed by adding the trusted properties at
the end. For these reasons, the feature is **not enabled by default**.
If you want to use it, you must turn it on (via
``SysSock.Annotate`` and ``Annotate``).

.. _flow-control-label:

Flow-control of Unix log sockets
================================

If processing queues fill up, the unix socket reader is blocked for a
short while to help prevent overrunning the queues. If the queues are
overrun, this may cause excessive disk-io and impact performance.

While turning on flow control for many systems does not hurt, it `can` lead
to a very unresponsive system and as such is disabled by default.

This means that log records are placed as quickly as possible into the
processing queues. If you would like to have flow control, you
need to enable it via the ``SysSock.FlowControl`` and ``FlowControl`` config
directives. Just make sure you have thought about the implications and have
tested the change on a non-production system first.

.. _application-timestamps-label:

Control over application timestamps
===================================

Application timestamps are ignored by default. This is needed, as some
programs (e.g. sshd) log with inconsistent timezone information, what
messes up the local logs (which by default don't even contain time zone
information). This seems to be consistent with what sysklogd has done for
many years. Alternate behaviour may be desirable if gateway-like processes
send messages via the local log slot. In that case, it can be enabled via
the ``SysSock.IgnoreTimestamp`` and ``IgnoreTimestamp`` config directives.

.. _systemd-details-label:

Coexistence with systemd
========================

Rsyslog should by default be configured for systemd support on all platforms
that usually run systemd (which means most Linux distributions, but not, for
example, Solaris).

Rsyslog is able to coexist with systemd with minimal changes on the part of the
local system administrator. While the ``systemd journal`` now assumes full
control of the the local ``/dev/log`` system log socket, systemd provides
access to logging data via the ``/run/systemd/journal/syslog`` log socket.
This log socket is provided by the ``syslog.socket`` file that is shipped
with systemd.

.. versionadded:: 8.32.0

   rsyslog emits an informational message noting the system log socket provided
   by systemd.

The imuxsock module can still be used in this setup and provides superior
performance over :doc:`imjournal <imjournal>`, the alternative journal input
module.

.. note::

  It must be noted, however, that the journal tends to drop messages
  when it becomes busy instead of forwarding them to the system log socket.
  This is because the journal uses an async log socket interface for forwarding
  instead of the traditional synchronous one.


Handling of sockets
-------------------

What follows is a brief description of the process rsyslog takes to determine
what system socket to use, which sockets rsyslog should listen on, whether
the sockets should be created and how rsyslog should handle the sockets when
shutting down.

Step 1: Select name of system socket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. If the user has not explicitly chosen to set ``SysSock.Use="off"`` then
   the default listener socket (aka, "system log socket" or simply "system
   socket") name is set to ``/dev/log``. Otherwise, if the user `has`
   explicitly set ``SysSock.Use="off"``, then rsyslog will not listen on
   ``/dev/log`` OR any socket defined by the ``SysSock.Name`` parameter and
   the rest of this section does not apply.

#. If the user has specified ``sysSock.Name="/path/to/custom/socket"`` (and not
   explicitly set ``SysSock.Use="off"``), then the default listener socket name
   is overwritten with ``/path/to/custom/socket``.

#. Otherwise, if rsyslog is running under systemd AND
   ``/run/systemd/journal/syslog`` exists, (AND the user has not
   explicitly set ``SysSock.Use="off"``) then the default listener socket name
   is overwritten with ``/run/systemd/journal/syslog``.


Step 2: Listen on specified sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  This is true for all sockets, be it system socket or not. But if
  ``SysSock.Use="off"``, the system socket will not be listened on.

rsyslog evaluates the list of sockets it has been asked to activate:

- the system log socket (if still enabled after completion of the last section)
- any custom inputs defined by the user

and then checks to see if it has been passed in via systemd (name is checked).
If it was passed in via systemd, the socket is used as-is (e.g., not recreated
upon rsyslog startup), otherwise if not passed in via systemd the log socket
is unlinked, created and opened.

Step 3: Shutdown log sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  This is true for all sockets, be it system socket or not.

Upon shutdown, rsyslog processes each socket it is listening on and evaluates
it. If the socket was originally passed in via systemd (name is checked), then
rsyslog does nothing with the socket (systemd maintains the socket).

If the socket was `not` passed in via systemd AND the configuration permits
rsyslog to do so (the default setting), rsyslog will unlink/remove the log
socket. If not permitted to do so (the user specified otherwise), then rsyslog
will not unlink the log socket and will leave that cleanup step to the
user or application that created the socket to remove it.


Statistic Counter
=================

This plugin maintains a global :doc:`statistics <../rsyslog_statistic_counter>` with the following properties:

-  **submitted** - total number of messages submitted for processing since startup

-  **ratelimit.discarded** - number of messages discarded due to rate limiting

-  **ratelimit.numratelimiters** - number of currently active rate limiters
   (smal data structures used for the rate limiting logic)

Caveats/Known Bugs
==================

- There is a compile-time limit of 50 concurrent sockets. If you need
  more, you need to change the array size in ``imuxsock.c``.

- When running under systemd, **many "sysSock." parameters are ignored**.
  See parameter descriptions and the :ref:`systemd-details-label` section for
  details.

- On systems where systemd is used this module is often not loaded by default.
  See the :ref:`systemd-details-label` section for details.

- Application timestamps are ignored by default. See the
  :ref:`application-timestamps-label` section for details.

Examples
========

Minimum setup
-------------

The following sample is the minimum setup required to accept syslog
messages from applications running on the local system.

.. code-block:: none

   module(load="imuxsock")

This only needs to be done once.


Enable flow control
-------------------

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2

   module(load="imuxsock" # needs to be done just once
          SysSock.FlowControl="on") # enable flow control (use if needed)

Enable trusted properties
-------------------------

As noted in the :ref:`trusted-properties-label` section, trusted properties
are disabled by default. If you want to use them, you must turn the feature
on via ``SysSock.Annotate`` for the system log socket and ``Annotate`` for
inputs.

Append to end of message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sample is used to activate message annotation and thus
trusted properties on the system log socket. These trusted properties
are appended to the end of each message.

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2

  module(load="imuxsock" # needs to be done just once
         SysSock.Annotate="on")


Store in JSON message properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sample is similiar to the first one, but enables parsing of
trusted properties, which places the results into JSON/lumberjack variables.

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2

  module(load="imuxsock"
         SysSock.Annotate="on" SysSock.ParseTrusted="on")

Read log data from jails
------------------------

The following sample is a configuration where rsyslogd pulls logs from
two jails, and assigns different hostnames to each of the jails:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

  module(load="imuxsock") # needs to be done just once
  input(type="imuxsock"
        HostName="jail1.example.net"
        Socket="/jail/1/dev/log") input(type="imuxsock"
        HostName="jail2.example.net" Socket="/jail/2/dev/log")

Read from socket on temporary file system
-----------------------------------------

The following sample is a configuration where rsyslogd reads the openssh
log messages via a separate socket, but this socket is created on a
temporary file system. As rsyslogd starts up before the sshd daemon, it needs
to create the socket directories, because it otherwise can not open the
socket and thus not listen to openssh messages.

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 3,4

  module(load="imuxsock") # needs to be done just once
  input(type="imuxsock"
        Socket="/var/run/sshd/dev/log"
        CreatePath="on")


Disable rate limiting
---------------------

The following sample is used to turn off input rate limiting on the
system log socket.

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 2

  module(load="imuxsock" # needs to be done just once
         SysSock.RateLimit.Interval="0") # turn off rate limiting
