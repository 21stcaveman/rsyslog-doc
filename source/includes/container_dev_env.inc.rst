.. note::

   The rsyslog project maintains
   `rsyslog docker development environment images <https://hub.docker.com/u/rsyslog/>`_.
   They are ready to go for the build. We recommend them over you own build
   environment - but you need to make sure it's the same distro/version
   if you want to copy the binary. Rsyslog docker development images
   are named `rsyslog_dev_` followed by the distro name.
