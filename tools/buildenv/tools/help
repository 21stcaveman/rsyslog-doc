echo 'docker run -v /your/local/path:/rsyslog-doc <container-name> command
where command is one of:
build-doc    - generate documentation (currently HTML only)
help         - display this help message
bash         - start an interactive shell (<CTL>-d terminates)
version-info - outputs some information of component used in container
git-clone    - clone the official rsyslog-doc project into /rsyslog mount
               this is a quick way to populate /rsyslog, which must be empty before

Environment variables (set with -eVAR=val on docker run):
FORMAT       - html (default) or another builder format
STRICT       - options to cause strict sphinx mode (default "-n -W")
SPHINX_EXTRA_OPTS - provides any option to sphinx the user whiches, e.g. -q for quiet builds
DEBUG         - set to "on" to turn on some minimal container debugging

bind mounts (mount with -v/local/path:/container on docker run):
/output      - output files will be placed here. If not mounted, output will be under
               /rsyslog-doc/output
/rsyslog-doc - checked-out rsyslog doc project; if not mounted but /output is, an
               automatic git clone is done to a temporary volume
